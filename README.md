# _Stock_Market_Analysis_

### Challenge:
- Working out a way to analyse three automobile giants namely Tesla, Ford and General Motors based on their pre historic stock prices and using different financial metrics and   check which company might have a higher return on investment based on their past data.

### Action: 
- Calculated technicals like volatility, moving averages (50 day and 200 day SMA), volume traded and their cumulative returns.
- Used Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Yahoo Finance etc. for analysis and visualization 

### Result:
- Out of the three stocks, Tesla proved out to be most profitable but also has a higher risk due to its maximum volatility. Out of General Motors and Ford, the trend seems to     be a lot closer to each other but General Motors just overpasses Ford in terms of cumulative returns despite having a similar volatility.
